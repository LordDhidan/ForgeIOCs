# ForgeIOC

ForgeIOC is a lightweight, offline-first IOC parser that helps security teams clean, classify, and operationalize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from threat intelligence feeds.

The tool is designed for real-world security operations where IOC lists are large, mixed, and often unstructured. ForgeIOC reduces manual work, prevents common errors, and helps engineers move faster and more accurately.

## Features

- Offline & portable (single HTML file)
- No installation required
- Automatic IOC parsing:
  - IP addresses
  - Domains / FQDNs
  - URLs
  - Hashes (MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256 / SHA512)
- Clean operational outputs ready for use
- Hash validation and filtering
- Light and Dark mode interface

## Why ForgeIOC?

Security teams often receive IOC feeds that:
- require manual cleanup,
- include misclassified hashes,
- contain mixed formats in a single file.

ForgeIOC turns raw threat intelligence into clean, structured outputs in seconds.

## How to Use

1. Download `Forge_IOCs.html`
2. Open it locally in your browser
3. Paste or upload IOC data
4. Parse and use the generated output

## Security & Privacy

ForgeIOC runs fully offline. No data is sent or collected.
